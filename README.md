A wine app that allows users to build their own archive.

Users can create a wine entry and document the descriptions of the bottle. This can be used for wine enthusiasts of all levels: archive a bottle you own in your collection, have come across during an occasion, or something you saw and would like to try for the future.

User can edit their own entries, and delete their own entries.
