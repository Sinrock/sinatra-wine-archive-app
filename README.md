# Wine Archive App

A wine app that allows users to build their own archive.

## Purpose and Use

This can be used for wine enthusiasts of all levels: Users can create a wine entry and document the descriptions of the bottle, archiving the bottle for their own virtual wine collection. If you've ever come come across a bottle during an occasion, would like to remember or commemorate for your memory, or something you saw and would like to try for the future, this app will help that you always remember the wines you liked and didn't like and hope to purchase again, since you can also list where it can be bought.

User can edit their own entries, and delete their own entries.
